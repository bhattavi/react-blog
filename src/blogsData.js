        description: "OutVoice, a startup that allows editors to pay freelancers with the click of a button, has officially left beta testing and is open to any publication. The company is also announcing that it has raised an undisclosed amount of seed funding from content monetization startup Coil. OutVoice  was founded by Matt Saincome and Issa Diao (pictured above). When the product was still in beta last year, Saincome told me it was created to solve “a horrible problem for everyone” involved in publishing freelance work: When he was a freelance writer, he’d have to constantly bug editors so that he could get paid, but then as the founder of the satirical sites The Hard Times and Hard Drive, he realized that managing payments was a huge headache. OutVoice simplifies the whole process by integrating directly into WordPress and other content management systems. When editors load a story into the CMS, they can also identify the contributor and the payment amount. Then once they hit publish, the payment is sent and should arrive in the freelancer’s back account within a few days. This means freelancers don’t have to worry about payment delays, while publications don’t have to worry about tracking invoices and writing checks (or losing their best writers and photographers if they don’t stay on top of this). OutVoice also handles the initial on-boarding paperwork that the freelancers need to fill out, and it creates monthly reports for accounting and taxes. Publications can pay for the service on either a per-transaction basis (5% of payments plus $1 per transaction) or through a monthly subscription, which starts at $29 per month. And by working with Coil,  OutVoice says it can take advantage of new payment technologies like Interledger. “Our goal at Coil is to make it easy and effortless for content creators to get paid,” said Coil CEO Stefan Thomas in a statement. “During their beta, OutVoice has already erased hundreds of years of lag time between freelance content creators and their paycheck. We’re excited to partner with OutVoice to promote more efficient payment solutions and processes, giving creators more time and money to create.”"

        description: "I have longed for this time of year, the month where we first laid eyes on the garden and I spied a few sprigs of wisteria in bloom climbing over the old crumbly walls above the back windows. As soon as I walked along the bumpy path from the back gate I could envisage how we would live here, that the garden would steal the show. 4 years almost to the day and everything has burst back into life, my wisteria hysteria is as strong as ever and slowly I can feel we are putting our stamp on the garden as much as we are the house. Just in time for the bank holiday fun this weekend! It’s easier to make quicker changes inside isn’t it? A coat of paint, a new carpet, not structural changes but aesthetic changes can transform a room.But a garden is harder. We are so lucky that the shrub beds are already full to the brim, a testament to 30 years of hard graft with a gardening glove. The patio itself is part of a bigger longer term plan so for now the circular shaped lawn looks back on the rickety pergola with an unruly kiwi plant that takes over each year (sadly no actual kiwis) and the open space in front of the double doors. We have brought in little touches like new outside lights and finally replaced our heavy timber round table and chairs, that had lasted so well for over ten years but gave up the ghost in the move. The back windows were replaced last year and painted in a pale warm grey and as much as I love the simplicity of a neutral scheme for me it lacked some serious colour and fun. I wish I was content with a palette of calming whites and greys but I just adore seeing a pop of pink or blue peeking out of the rattan chairs and when I spied all the gorgeous greens in Homesense - well - sold to the lady’s patio in need of some late spring cheer!"

The new line launches with two multi-sensor products: StormCaster-T, which delivers continuous zoom and longwave infrared (LWIR) imaging, and StormCaster-L, which provides ultra-low-light imaging, tracking and mapping.

That deal put Aeryon’s proven airframes under the control of FLIR and was testament to the potential drone technology has in the world of public safety. The new FLIR StormCaster payloads can be used with the SkyRanger R70 and R80D SkyRaider. “StormCaster-L and –T are just the beginning of this new line of advanced, high-performance payloads for our small, tactical UAS platforms,” said David Ray, president of the Government and Defense Business Unit at FLIR. “For mission needs ranging from force protection and border security to clandestine operations, FLIR StormCaster will provide heightened situational awareness, bolstered by our aircraft’s onboard, real-time artificial intelligence. “We will develop more multi-sensor payloads through 2020 that deliver on our promise to offer capabilities at the individual operator level that previously required larger, more expensive UAS,” Ray added. FLIR says the new StormCaster payloads reflect “a leap forward in scalable performance”, pointing to a 7X improvement in line-of-sight stabilization, an enhanced range of motion, and greater geolocation accuracy. The new payloads can be used interchangeably between FLIR SkyRanger and SkyRaider UAS systems and will help the military, public safety and security teams make the most of advances in aircraft performance. Regulations are developing around the use of drones at night and beyond line of sight. The number of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions are expected to grow considerably on top of the military demand that already exists for situational awareness tools."

        description: "Congestion pricing — the tolling of vehicles entering the Central Business District — will arrive in New York City in a little more than a year, and policy makers are grappling with a host of questions about its implementation. An important one is: What mix of vehicles do we want in the congestion-pricing zone? We should explore how the choice of vehicle affects congestion, and how we might reduce congestion even further by incentivizing smaller vehicles on our streets — such as motorcycles. Size matters on the crowded streets of this city — and, in this case, smaller is better. Motorcycles should get a discount or an exemption from congestion pricing because they are incrementally “better” than the cars we are trying to restrict with a high toll. They take up far less space than regular cars — especially the SUVs that dominate our roads and cause a disproportionate amount of carnage. For instance, the wheelbase of a Chevy Suburban is almost 11 feet, while the wheelbase of my motorcycle is less than 5 feet. Plus, it’s legal in New York State for two motorcycles to travel side by side in the same lane. That’s at least four people on four vehicles in the space of one SUV. Or eight, if each motorcycle also has a passenger — in other words, many more people than an SUV, which often has just one person in it. It’s not just about size, though, but social and environmental impact. That Suburban gets an EPA combined gas mileage of 18 miles to the gallon. My motorcycle? I’m averaging about 50 miles per gallon. (Nope, it’s not a hybrid.) Electric motorcycles, scooters, and mopeds exist, too — just download the Revel app! Further, heavy vehicles like SUVs are associated with greater traffic fatalities. The city’s Department of Transportation recently began tracking the kinds of vehicles involved in crashes because of the huge jump in pedestrian and cyclist fatalities from SUVs. So, what could happen if we charge SUVs more while charging motorcycles less, or even nothing?  Maybe not much in the first year of congestion pricing — but what about five years later, or 10 or 20? Internationally, evidence from municipalities with congestion pricing suggests that differentiating tolling by size of vehicle can reduce congestion. London and Stockholm, for example, both exempt motorcycles from tolls in order to encourage switching from automobiles to motorcycles. In New York City, however, we lack tools to thoroughly analyze the benefits of switching to smaller vehicles. The influential Regional Plan Association recently examined the traffic, environmental, health and revenue benefits of several options for implementing congestion pricing. The RPA stated that “[l]arger vehicles have a larger impact and should be charged more.” But it didn’t explore the effects of passenger vehicle size because current traffic models don’t enable us to do so. We need new models. We actually do have a living example of “size-switching,” as well as a possible data source, however: The moped-sharing company Revel claims that its trips are mostly “battery-powered replacements for Uber rides.” I can support the general premise: using my motorcycle, I take trips that I once took using Lyft and Juno. If we multiplied that “size-switching” effect by a factor of five, or 50, or 500, what would it mean for congestion in Manhattan? Without incentivizing smaller vehicles, we could be missing out on chances to reduce congestion … without even realizing it. If you are a transportation-policy modeler and are up to the challenge of modeling how finicky human beings might switch between different vehicle sizes in response to congestion fees, send me a message. Let’s talk about where we can get the data and how we can make a useful policy model. Large municipalities all over the country are watching us, the first large American city to implement a central business district congestion-pricing scheme. Here’s our chance to show what we can do. Manhattan resident Chris Sequeira (@chrisjsequeira) is a transportation-environmental modeler and community-engagement specialist. The opinions he expresses herein are not necessarily shared by Streetsblog, which consistently covers the battle to remove motorized vehicles from the streets of New York."
